# Javascript-Signals

A javascript signal implementation, inspired by Robert Penner's [as3-signals](https://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals) library.

Before i'll be able to write some simple example, take a look at the example folder, where i wrote an example for each type of Signal. These examples
are the ones that Robert Penners had in his as3-signals page.
